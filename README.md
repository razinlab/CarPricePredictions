# Car Price Predictions
## Project Overview
This project predicts car prices based on a few different attributes such as model, year, mileage, fuel economy, etc. It demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, machine learning modeling and model evaluation.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
- Regression Modeling (Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost Forest)
- Error Evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R^2)
- Cross Validation
- Hyperparameter Tuning (Randomized Search)

## Results
An XGBoost random forest regressor did the best job while being faster than a decision tree. Predictions averaged 20% of the standard deviation in the data. Parameter tuning improved the model by about 20-30%.
